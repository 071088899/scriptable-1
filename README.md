# scriptable

A collection of my scriptable.app scripts.

These are open-spource and your are free to use them for your personal use. It would be nice to get credit for them though.

If you enjoy these scripts and find them useful, please consider sponsoring so I can continue the work that I do.

## Scripts

This does depend on the Cache.js script (above) from [EvanDColeman](https://github.com/evandcoleman) also. Make sure you put it in Scriptable too.
